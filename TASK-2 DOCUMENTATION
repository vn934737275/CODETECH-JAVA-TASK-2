Overview:

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a Java program that enables two players to play the classic game on a 3x3 grid. The program facilitates player moves, checks for wins and draws, and handles invalid moves.

Features:

-> Player Interaction: Players take turns entering their moves.
-> Win Detection: The program checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins.
-> Draw Detection: Detects when the game ends in a draw.
-> Input Validation: Ensures that players enter valid moves within the bounds of the grid and on empty cells.
-> Simple Interface: Provides a text-based interface for player interaction.

Implementation:

    Main Method:
        The main method initializes the game, prints the welcome message, and starts the game loop.
        The game loop continues until the gameOver flag becomes true, indicating the end of the game.

    Game Initialization:
        The initializeBoard method initializes the game board with empty cells represented by underscores (_).
        The currentPlayer variable keeps track of the player currently making a move.
        The gameOver flag determines when the game ends.

    Player Move:
        The playerMove method prompts the current player to enter their move (row and column numbers).
        Input validation is performed in the isValidMove method to ensure the entered move is valid.
        If the move is valid, the cell on the board corresponding to the entered row and column is updated with the current player's mark (X or O).

    Win and Draw Detection:
        The checkWin method checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins for the current player.
        The checkDraw method checks if the game ends in a draw by verifying if all cells on the board are filled with marks.

    Switching Players:
        The switchPlayer method alternates the current player between X and O after each move.

Usage:

    Compile the Program:

javac TicTacToe.java

Run the Program:

    java TicTacToe

    Follow On-Screen Instructions:
        Enter row and column numbers (1-3) to make a move when prompted.
        The game will display the current state of the board after each move.

The Tic-Tac-Toe program is designed to provide a simple and interactive experience for playing the game. Here's how it works:

Initialization:
      Upon starting the program, the game initializes the 3x3 grid with empty cells.
Player Interaction: 
      Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers where they want to place their mark (X or O).
Win and Draw Detection: 
      After each move, the program checks if the current player has achieved a win condition or if the game has ended in a draw.
Input Validation: 
      The program ensures that players enter valid moves by checking if the specified row and column numbers correspond to empty cells on the board.
Switching Players: 
      After each move, the program alternates between players, allowing them to take turns.
Game End: 
      The game ends when a player wins or when the board is filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.
